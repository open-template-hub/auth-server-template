## How to contribute to Open Template Hub

### Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into issue, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing to Open Template Hub guide to know more about coding conventions etc.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Open Template Hub will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change in the feature request issues and start writing code.

### Do you want to contribute to the Open Template Hub documentation?

Please read Contributing to the Open Template Hub Documentation.

This is a volunteer effort we know the value of your time. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! ðŸ’š
